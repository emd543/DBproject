Tested "sudo apachectl start" and stop; they work.
Created ~/Sites folder
Created evan.conf under "/etc/apache2/users/"
Edited evan.conf to include:
  <Directory "/Users/evan/Sites/">
  AllowOverride All
  Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
  Require all granted
  </Directory>
Uncommented "LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so" in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
* Did not (but might need to later) uncomment "LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so" in the same file. This does not exist, but there is an otherwise-identical line for php7
Uncommented "Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf" in the same file
Uncommented "Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf" in /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
Tested "http://localhost/~evan/" and it works
Set "AllowOverride All" in httpd.conf
(Did not set to allow URL rewrites, at least not yet)
Uncommented "LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so" (The ref I'm using said php5, but that is dated)
The test doc doesn't really work
Install and set up MySQL. Get an error when starting MySQL via bash, since the server quits without updating the PID file
Added "export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" to .bash_profile and restarted bash
mysql -v still doesn't work
Test MySQL, still having problems.
Uninstalled MySQL 8, downloaded and installed MySQL 5.7.26 instead. Set this up more properly, and it seems to actually work now.
Installed PopSQL, as a more pleasant interface for using MySQL. But will also use the command line to get used to both.

Later:
Installed MySQL 8 again.

---------

Later:

cd /etc/apache2/users
sudo nano username.conf
Added:
<Directory "/Users/username/Sites/">
AllowOverride All
Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
Require all granted
</Directory>

sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
Made sure the following was uncommented:
LoadModule authz_core_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_core.so
LoadModule authz_host_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_host.so
LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so
LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
Uncommented:
LoadModule include_module libexec/apache2/mod_include.so
LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so

sudo nano /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
Made sure the following was uncommented:
Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf

Home directory
nano .bash_profile
Verified that this had:
export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"

Fix 2002 socket error:
sudo mkdir /var/mysql
sudo ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/mysql/mysql.sock

Unzipped phpmyadmin, and renamed the new folder to "phpmyadmin"
Moved that folder into ~/Sites/
mkdir ~/Sites/phpmyadmin/config
http://localhost/~evan/phpmyadmin/setup/

phpmyadmin couldn't log into the MySQL server.
Uninstalled MySQL, downloaded MySQL 8.0.17
Installed again, this time with legacy password encryption
Now phpmyadmin works.
