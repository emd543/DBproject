Tested "sudo apachectl start" and stop; they work.
Created ~/Sites folder
Created evan.conf under "/etc/apache2/users/"
Edited evan.conf to include:
  <Directory "/Users/evan/Sites/">
  AllowOverride All
  Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
  Require all granted
  </Directory>
Uncommented "LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so" in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
* Did not (but might need to later) uncomment "LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so" in the same file. This does not exist, but there is an otherwise-identical line for php7
Uncommented "Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf" in the same file
Uncommented "Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf" in /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
Tested "http://localhost/~evan/" and it works
